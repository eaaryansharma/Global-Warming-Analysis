# Global-Warming-Analysis
Advanced Global Warming Analysis using Plotly . 

After analysing the global land and ocean temperatures of the last 185 years it can clearly be concluded  that there has been a global increasing trend in temperature, particularly since 1975 . The rate of global warming has increased rapidly since 1975 which has been the result of the increase in industrialisation, deforestation and due to the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. 
After predicting the average temperatures of the the future by using a machine learning model we can clearly see that mankind must reflect and take the phenomenon of global warming seriously  and take all necessary actions to reduce global warming.
